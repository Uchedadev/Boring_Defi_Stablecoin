We are building a StableCoin that is 
1. Pegged to the usd- 1 DSC to 1 USD
    We will check the price of usd via chainlink pricefeed
    We will set up an automation to exchange eth/btc for DSC
2. Our stability mechanism will be Algorithmic (Decentralised)
    People can only mint our stable coin when they have enough collateral(coded in the contract)

3. Our Collateral will be exogenus, we will use crypto (eth and btc) as only collaterals
    More like Wrapped eth and Wrapped btc
